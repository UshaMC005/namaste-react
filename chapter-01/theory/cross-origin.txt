What is crossorigin in script tag?
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to 
load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource 
(e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
